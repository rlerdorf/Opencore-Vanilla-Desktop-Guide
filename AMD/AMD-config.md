# AMD

## Starting Point

You'll want to start with the sample.plist that OpenCorePkg provides you in the DOCS folder and rename it to config.plist. Next, open up your favourite XML editor like [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) and we can get to work. **Reminder configurators are not supported, most are out of date with the OpenCore spec and some like Mackie's will even add clover sections and corrupt plists. You are on your own if you use such tools**

Users of ProperTree will also get the benefit of running the Snapshot function which will add all the Firmware drivers, kexts and SSDTs into your config.plist(Cmd/Crtl + R and point to your OC folder).

Kernel patches courtesy of [AMD OSX](https://github.com/AMD-OSX/AMD_Vanilla/tree/opencore)(save these for later, we'll go over how to use them below):
* [Ryzen/Threadripper(17h)](https://github.com/khronokernel/Opencore-Vanilla-Desktop-Guide/blob/master/extra-files/17h-patches.plist.zip) (10.13, 10.14, and 10.15)
* [Bulldozer/Jaguar(15h/16h)](https://github.com/khronokernel/Opencore-Vanilla-Desktop-Guide/blob/master/extra-files/15h-16h-patches.plist.zip) (10.13, 10.14, and 10.15)


**And read this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.**

## ACPI

![ACPI](https://i.imgur.com/zqNt4dV.png)


**Add:**

This is where you'll add SSDT patches for your system, these are most useful for laptops and OEM desktops but also common for [USB maps](https://usb-map.gitbook.io/project/), [disabling unsupported GPUs](/post-install/spoof.md) and such. And with most systems like ours, **even required to boot**. Guide on making them found here: [**Getting started with ACPI**](../extras/acpi.md)

* [SSDT-EC-USBX](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/AcpiSamples/SSDT-EC-USBX.dsl)
   * Corrects your EC devices, **needed for all Catalina users**. To setup you'll need to find out the name of your `PNP0C09` device in your DSDT, this being either `EC0`, `H_EC`, `PGEC` and `ECDV`. You can read more about Embedded Controller issues in Catalina here: [What's new in macOS Catalina](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/den28t/whats_new_in_macos_catalina/). If no `PNP0C09` device shows up then there is no need for this SSDT. 
   * This SSDT also has a second function, USBX. This is used for forcing USB power properties, requires SSDT-EC so this just jumbles them together.
   * I've also provided a precompiled version for users with EC0, this is the most common device on AMD systems: [SSDT-EC-USBX-AMD.aml](https://github.com/khronokernel/Opencore-Vanilla-Desktop-Guide/blob/master/extra-files/SSDT-EC-USBX-AMD.aml)
 

For those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the [**Getting started with ACPI**](../extras/acpi.md) **page.** Compiled SSDTs have a **.aml** extension\(Assembled\) and will go into the `EFI/OC/ACPI` folder and **must** be specified in your config under `ACPI -> Add` as well.

**Block**

This drops certain ACPI tabes from loading, for us we can ignore this

**Patch**:

This section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. Most PCs do not ACPI patches, so in the majority of the cases, you need to do nothing here. For those who need DSDT patches for things like XHC controllers, use SSDTs or similar Device Property patching like what's seen with Framebuffer patching. 

And to grab the location of such devices you can use [gfxutil](https://github.com/acidanthera/gfxutil/releases).

* **Comment** 
   * Name of patch
* **Count** 
   * How many time the patch is applied, `0` will apply to all instances
* **Enabled** 
   * Self-explanatory, enables or disables the patch
* **Find**
   * The original name in ACPI
* **Replace** 
   * The new name in ACPI, the length must match original

**Quirk**: Settings for ACPI.

* **FadtEnableReset**: NO
   * Enable reboot and shutdown on legacy hardware, not recommended unless needed
* **NormalizeHeaders**: NO
   * Cleanup ACPI header fields, only relevant for macOS High Sierra 10.13
* **RebaseRegions**: NO
   * Attempt to heuristically relocate ACPI memory regions, not needed unless custom DSDT is used.
* **ResetHwSig**: NO
   * Needed for hardware that fails to maintain hardware signature across the reboots and cause issues with waking from hibernation
* **ResetLogoStatus**: NO
   * Workaround for OEM Windows logo not drawing on systems with BGRT tables.

## Booter

![Booter](https://i.imgur.com/suElruh.png)

This section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with FwRuntimeServices, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi

**MmioWhitelist**:

This section is allowing devices to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, most users can ignore this section.

**Quirks**:

* **AvoidRuntimeDefrag**: YES
   * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc
* **DevirtualiseMmio**: NO
   * Reduces Stolen Memory Footprint, expands options for `slide=N` values and generally useful for most firmware though breaks on some AMD systems.
* **DisableSingleUser**: NO
   * Disables the use of `Cmd+S` and `-s`, this is closer to the behaviour of T2 based machines
* **DisableVariableWrite**: NO
   * Needed for systems with non-functioning NVRAM like Z390 and such
* **DiscardHibernateMap**: NO
   * Reuse original hibernate memory map, only needed for certain legacy hardware 
* **EnableSafeModeSlide**: YES
   * Allows for slide values to be used in Safemode
* **EnableWriteUnprotector**: YES
   * Removes write protection from CR0 register during their execution
* **ForceExitBootServices**: NO
   * Ensures ExitBootServices calls succeeds even when MemoryMap has changed, don't use unless necessary 
* **ProtectCsmRegion**: NO
   * Needed for fixing artefacts and sleep-wake issues, AvoidRuntimeDefrag resolves this already so avoid this quirk unless necessary
* **ProvideCustomSlide**: YES
   * If there's a conflicting slide value, this option forces macOS to use a pseudo-random value. Needed for those receiving `Only N/256 slide values are usable!` debug message
* **SetupVirtualMap**: YES
   * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses
* **ShrinkMemoryMap**: NO
   * Needed for systems with large memory maps that don't fit, don't use unless necessary
* **SignalAppleOs**: NO
   * Tricks the hardware into thinking its always booting macOS, mainly benifitial for MacBook Pro's with dGPUs as booting Windows won't allow for the iGPU to be used

## DeviceProperties

![DeviceProperties](https://i.imgur.com/ThtAO95.png)

**Add**: Sets device properties from a map.

By default, the sample.plist has this section set for iGPU and audio. We have no iGPU so PCIRoot `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)` can be removed, and for audio we'll be setting that up in the boot-args section. So we can also remove `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)`

TL;DR, delete the PCIRoot's here as we won't be using this section.

## Kernel

![Kernel](https://i.imgur.com/ehG6Da6.png)

**Add**: Here's where you specify which kexts to load, order matters here so make sure Lilu.kext is always first! Other higher priority kexts come after Lilu such as VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc. A reminder that [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) users can run Cmd/Ctrl+R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out.

* **BundlePath** 
   * Name of the kext
   * ex: `Lilu.kext`
* **Enabled** 
   * Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext
* **ExecutablePath** 
   * Path to the actual executable hidden within the kext, you can see what path you kext has by right-clicking and selecting `Show Package Contents`. Generally, they'll be `Contents/MacOS/Kext` but some have kexts hidden within under `Plugin` folder. Do note that plist only kexts do not need this filled in.
   * ex: `Contents/MacOS/Lilu`
* **PlistPath** 
   * Path to the `info.plist` hidden within the kext
   * ex: `Contents/Info.plist`

**Emulate**: Needed for spoofing unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and Celerons(AMD CPUs don't require this)

* **CpuidMask**: When set to Zero, original CPU bit will be used
   * `<Clover_FCPUID_Extended_to_4_bytes_Swapped_Bytes> | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00`
   * ex: CPUID `0x0306A9` would be `A9 06 03 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00`
* **CpuidData**: The value for the CPU spoofing
   * `FF FF FF FF | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00`
   * Swap `00` for `FF` if needing to swap with a longer value

**Block**: Blocks kexts from loading. Sometimes needed for disabling Apple's trackpad driver for some laptops.

**Patch**: This is where the AMD kernel patching magic happens. Please do note that `KernelToPatch` and `MatchOS` from Clover becomes `Kernel` and `MinKernel`/ `MaxKernel` in OpenCore, you can find pre-made patches by [AlGrey](https://amd-osx.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=10918&sid=e0feb8a14a97be482d2fd68dbc268f97)(algrey#9303):

Kernel patches:
* [Ryzen/Threadripper(17h)](https://github.com/khronokernel/Opencore-Vanilla-Desktop-Guide/blob/master/extra-files/17h-patches.plist.zip) (10.13, 10.14, and 10.15)
* [Bulldozer/Jaguar(15h/16h)](https://github.com/khronokernel/Opencore-Vanilla-Desktop-Guide/blob/master/extra-files/15h-16h-patches.plist.zip) (10.13, 10.14, and 10.15)

To merge:
* Open both files, 
* Delete the `Kernel -> Patch` section from config.plist
* Copy the `Kernel -> Patch` section from patches.plist
* Paste into where old patches were in config.plist

![](/extra-files/gif.gif)

**Quirks**:

* **AppleCpuPmCfgLock**: NO 
   * Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS, Clover counterpart would be AppleIntelCPUPM. AMD users can ignore
* **AppleXcpmCfgLock**: NO 
   * Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS, Clover counterpart would be KernelPM. AMD users can ignore
* **AppleXcpmExtraMsrs**: NO 
   * Disables multiple MSR access needed for unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and certain Xeons
* **AppleXcpmForceBoost**: NO
   * Forces maximum multiplier, only recommended to enable on scientific or media calculation machines that are constantly under load. Main Xeons benifit from this
* **CustomSMBIOSGuid**: NO 
   * Performs GUID patching for UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode. Usually relevant for Dell laptops. To be used in tandom with `PlatformInfo -> UpdateSMBIOSMode -> Custom`
* **DisableIOMapper**: NO 
   * Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems. Effects on AMD systems vary so recommended to disable SVM(SecureVirtualMachine) in BIOS
* **DummyPowerManagement**: YES
   * New alternative to NullCPUPowerManagement, required for all AMD CPU based systems as there's no native power management. Intel can ignore
* **ExternalDiskIcons**: YES 
   * External Icons Patch, for when internal drives are treated as external drives but can also make USB drives internal. For NVMe on Z87 and below you just add built-in property via DeviceProperties.
* **IncreasePciBarSize**: NO
   * Increases 32-bit PCI bar size in IOPCIFamily from 1 to 4 GB, enabling Above4GDecoding in the BIOS is a much cleaner and safer approach. Some X99 boards may require this, you'll generally expereince a kernel panic on IOPCIFamily if you need this
* **LapicKernelPanic**: NO 
   * Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is `Kernel LAPIC`
* **PanicNoKextDump**: YES 
   * Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur
* **PowerTimeoutKernelPanic**: YES
   * Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio.
* **ThirdPartyDrives**: NO 
   * Enables TRIM, not needed for NVMe but AHCI based drives may require this. Please check under system report to see if your drive supports TRIM
* **XhciPortLimit**: YES 
* This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. A more proper solution for AMD can be found here: [AMD USB Mapping](https://github.com/khronokernel/Opencore-Vanilla-Desktop-Guide/blob/master/AMD/AMD-USB-map.md)


## Misc

![Misc](https://i.imgur.com/4ORf7HB.png)

**Boot**: Settings for boot screen \(leave as-is unless you know what you're doing\)
* **HibernateMode**: None
   * Best to avoid hibernation with Hackintoshes all together
* **HideSelf**: YES
   * Hides the EFI partition as a boot option in OC's boot picker
* **PollAppleHotKeys**: NO
   * Allows you to use Apple's hotkeys during boot, depending on the firmware you may need to use AppleUsbKbDxe.efi instead of OpenCore's builtin support. Do note that if you can select anything in OC's picker, disabling this option can help. Popular commands:
      * `Cmd+V`: Enables verbose
      * `Cmd+Opt+P+R`: Cleans NVRAM 
      * `Cmd+R`: Boots Recovery partition
      * `Cmd+S`: Boot in Single-user mode
      * `Option/Alt`: Shows boot picker when `ShowPicker` set to `NO`, an alternative is `ESC` key
* **Timeout**: `5`
   * This sets how long OpenCore will wait until it automatically boots from the default selection
* **ShowPicker**: YES
   * Shows OpenCore's UI, needed for seeing your available drives or set to NO to follow default option
* **TakeoffDelay**: `0`
   * Used to add a delay for hotkeys when OpenCore is a bit to fast to register, 5000-10000 microseconds is the prefered range for users with broken hotkeys support
* **UsePicker**: YES
   * Uses OpenCore's default GUI, set to NO if you wish to use a different GUI

**Debug**: Debug has special use cases, leave as-is unless you know what you're doing.

* **DisableWatchDog**: YES \(Useful for when OpenCore is stalling on something while booting, can also help for early macOS boot issues\)
* **Target**: `67`
   * Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore
* **DisplayLevel**: `2147483714`
   * Shows even more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore

These values are based of those calculated in [OpenCore debugging](/troubleshooting/debug.md)

**Security**: Security is pretty self-explanatory.

* **AllowNvramReset**: YES
   * Allows for NVRAM reset both in the boot picker and when pressing `Cmd+Opt+P+R`
* **AllowSetDefault**: YES
   * Allow `CTRL+Enter` and `CTRL+Index` to set default boot device in the picker
* **AuthRestart**: NO:
   * Enables Authenticated restart for FileVault2 so password is not required on reboot. Can be concidered a secuirty risk so optional
* **ExposeSensitiveData**: `6`
   * Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore
* **RequireSignature**: NO
   * We won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore
* **RequireVault**: NO
   * We won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore as well
* **ScanPolicy**: `0` 
   * `0` allows you to see all drives available, please refer to [Security](/post-install/security.md) section for further details

**Tools** Used for running OC debugging tools like clearing NVRAM
* **Name**
   * Name shown in OpenCore
* **Enabled**
   * Self-explanatory, enables or disables
* **Path**
   * Path to file after the `Tools` folder
   * ex: [Shell.efi](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCoreShell/releases)

**Entries**: Used for specifying irregular boot paths that can't be found naturally with OpenCore
* **Name**
   * Name shown in boot picker
* **Enabled**
   * Self-explanatory, enables or disables
* **Path**
   * PCI route of boot drive, can be found with the [OpenCoreShell](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCoreShell/releases) and the `map` command
   * ex: `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1D,0x4)/Pci(0x0,0x0)/NVMe(0x1,09-63-E3-44-8B-44-1B-00)/HD(1,GPT,11F42760-7AB1-4DB5-924B-D12C52895FA9,0x28,0x64000)/\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi`

## NVRAM

![NVRAM](https://i.imgur.com/rRU63NJ.png)

**Add**: 

4D1EDE05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14 \(Booter Path, majority can ignore but \)

* **UIScale**:
   * 01: Standard resolution(Clover equivalent is `0x28`)
   * 02: HiDPI (generally required for FileVault to function correctly on smaller displays, Clover equivalent is `0x2A`\)

7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 \(System Integrity Protection bitmask\)

* **boot-args**:
   * **-v** - this enables verbose mode, which shows all the behind-the-scenes text that scrolls by as you're booting instead of the Apple logo and progress bar. It's invaluable to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem kexts, etc.
   * **debug=0x100** - this disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot on a kernel panic. That way you can \(hopefully\) glean some useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the issues.

   * **keepsyms=1** - this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic itself.
   * **npci=0x2000** - this disables some PCI debugging related to `kIOPCIConfiguratorPFM64`, alternative is `npci= 0x3000` which disables debugging related to `gIOPCITunnelledKey`. Required for when getting stuck on `PCI Start Configuration` as there are IRQ conflicts relating to your PCI lanes. **Not needed if Above4GDecoding is enabled**
   * **agdpmod=pikera** - used for disabling boardID on Navi GPUs(RX 5000 series), without this you'll get a black screen. **Don't use if you don't have Navi**
   * **alcid=1** - used for setting layout-id for AppleALC, see [supported codecs](https://github.com/acidanthera/applealc/wiki/supported-codecs) to figure out which layout to use for your specific system.
   
   
* **csr-active-config**: Settings for SIP, generally recommended to manually change this within Recovery partition with `csrutil` via the recovery partition.

csr-active-config is set to `00000000` which enables System Integrity Protection. You can choose a number of other options to enable/disable sections of SIP. Some common ones are as follows:

* `00000000` - SIP completely enabled
* `30000000` - Allow unsigned kexts and writing to protected fs locations
* `E7030000` - SIP completely disabled

Recommended to leave enabled for best secuirty practices

* **nvda\_drv**: &lt;&gt; 
   * For enabling Nvidia WebDrivers, set to 31 if running a [Maxwell or Pascal GPU](https://khronokernel-3.gitbook.io/catalina-gpu-buyers-guide/). This is the same as setting nvda\_drv=1 but instead we translate it from [text to hex](https://www.browserling.com/tools/hex-to-text), Clover equivalent is `NvidiaWeb`. **AMD and Intel GPU users should leave this area blank.**
* **prev-lang:kbd**: &lt;&gt; 
   * Needed for non-Latin keyboards in the format of `lang-COUNTRY:keyboard`, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(**Default in Sample config is Russian**):
      * American: `en-US:0`(`656e2d55533a30` in HEX)
      * Full list can be found in [AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt](https://github.com/acidanthera/OcSupportPkg/blob/master/Utilities/AppleKeyboardLayouts/AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt)

**Block**: Forcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that `Add` will not overwrite values already present in NVRAM so values like `boot-args` should be left.


**LegacyEnable**: NO
* Allows for NVRAM to be stored on nvram.plist, needed for systems without native NVRAM

**LegacyOverwrite**: NO
* Permits overwriting firmware variables from nvram.plist, only needed for systems without native NVRAM

**LegacySchema**
* Used for assigning NVRAM variables, used with LegacyEnable set to YES

**WriteFlash**: YES
* Enables writing to flash memory for all added variables.

## Platforminfo

![PlatformInfo](https://i.imgur.com/CrqeCea.png)

For setting up the SMBIOS info, we'll use CorpNewt's [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) application. 

For this example, we'll choose the iMacPro1,1 SMBIOS but some SMBIOS play with certain GPUs better than others:

* iMacPro1,1: AMD RX Polaris and newer
* MacPro7,1: AMD RX Polaris and newer(Note that MacPro7,1 is also a Catalina exclusive)
* MacPro6,1: AMD R5/R7/R9 and older
* iMac14,2: Nvidia Kepler and newer


Run GenSMBIOS, pick option 1. for downloading MacSerial and Option 3. for selecting out SMBIOS.  This will give us an output similar to the following:

```text
  #######################################################
 #              iMacPro1,1 SMBIOS Info                 #
#######################################################

Type:         iMacPro1,1
Serial:       C02YX0TZHX87
Board Serial: C029269024NJG36CB
SmUUID:       DEA17B2D-2F9F-4955-B266-A74C47678AD3
```

The order is `Product | Serial | Board Serial (MLB)`

The `Type` part gets copied to Generic -&gt; SystemProductName.

The `Serial` part gets copied to Generic -&gt; SystemSerialNumber.

The `Board Serial` part gets copied to Generic -&gt; MLB.

The `SmUUID` part gets copied toto Generic -&gt; SystemUUID.

We set Generic -&gt; ROM to either an Apple ROM \(dumped from a real Mac\), your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use `11223300 0000`. After install follow the [Fixing iServices](/post-install/iservices.md) page on how to find your real MAC Address)

**Reminder that you want valid serial numbers but those not in use, you want to get a message back like: "Purchase Date not Validated"**

[Apple Check Coverage page](https://checkcoverage.apple.com)

**Automatic**: YES 
* Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections
* **SpoofVendor**: YES
   * Swaps vendor field for Acidanthera, generally not safe to use Apple as a vendor in most case

**UpdateDataHub**: YES
* Update Data Hub fields

**UpdateNVRAM**: YES
* Update NVRAM fields

**UpdateSMBIOS**: YES
* Updates SMBIOS fields

**UpdateSMBIOSMode**: Create

## UEFI

![UEFI](https://i.imgur.com/UiGGDWK.png)

**ConnectDrivers**: YES 
* Forces .efi drivers, change to NO will automatically connect added UEFI drivers. This can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves. E.g. certain file system drivers may not load.

**Drivers**: Add your .efi drivers here

**Input**: Related to boot.efi keyboard passthrough used for FileVault and Hotkey support

* **KeyForgetThreshold**: `5`
   * The delay between each key input when holding a key down, for best results use `5` milliseconds
* **KeyMergeThreshold**: `2`
   * The length of time that a key will be registered before resetting, for best results use `2` milliseconds
* **KeySupport**: `YES`
   * Enables OpenCore's built in key support and **required for boot picker selection**, do not use with AppleUsbKbDxe.efi
* **KeySupportMode**: `Auto`
   * Keyboard translation for OpenCore
* **KeySwap**: `NO`
   * Swaps `Option` and `Cmd` key
* **PointerSupport**: 
   * Used for fixing broken pointer support, commonly used for Z87 Asus boards. Leave blank
* **PointerSupportMode**:
   * Specifies OEM protocol, currently only supports Z87 and Z97 ASUS boards so leave blank
* **TimerResolution**: `50000`
   * Set architecture timer resolution, Asus Z87 boards use `60000` for the interface. Settings to `0` can also work for some

**Protocols**: (Most values can be ignored here as they're meant for real Macs/VMs)

* **AppleSmcIo**: NO
   * Reinstalls Apple SMC I/O, this is the equivlant of VirtualSMC.efi which is only needed for users using FileVault
* **ConsoleControl**: YES
   * Replaces Console Control protocol with a builtin version, set to YES otherwise you may see text output during booting instead of nice Apple logo. Required for most APTIO firmware
* **FirmwareVolume**: NO
   * Fixes UI regarding Filevault, set to YES for better FileVault compatibility
* **HashServices**: NO
   * Fixes incorrect cursor size when running FileVault, set to YES for better FileVault compatibility
* **UnicodeCollation**: NO
   * Some older firmware have broken Unicode collation, fixes UEFI shell compatibility on these systems(generally IvyBridge and older)

**Quirks**:

* **AvoidHighAlloc**: NO
   * Workaround for when te motherboard can't properly access higher memory in UEFI Boot Services. Avoid unless necessary(affected models: GA-Z77P-D3 (rev. 1.1))
* **ExitBootServicesDelay**: `0`
   * Only required for very specific use cases like setting to `5` for ASUS Z87-Pro running FileVault2
* **IgnoreInvalidFlexRatio**: NO
   * Fix for when MSR\_FLEX\_RATIO \(0x194\) can't be disabled in the BIOS, required for all pre-skylake based systems

   * Fix for UI corruption when both text and graphics outputs happen, set to YES with SanitiseClearScreen also set to YES for pure Apple Logo\(no verbose screen\)
* **ProvideConsoleGop**: YES
   * Enables GOP\(Graphics output Protcol\) which the macOS bootloader requires for console handle, **required for seeing once the kernel takes over**
* **ReleaseUsbOwnership**: NO
   * Releases USB controller from firmware driver, needed for when your firmware doesn't support EHCI/XHCI Handoff. Clover equivalent is `FixOwnership`
* **RequestBootVarFallback**: YES
   * Request fallback of some Boot prefixed variables from `OC_VENDOR_VARIABLE_GUID` to `EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID`. Used for fixing boot options.
* **RequestBootVarRouting**: YES
   * Redirects AptioMemeoryFix from `EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID` to `OC\_VENDOR\_VARIABLE\_GUID`. Needed for when firmware tries to delete boot entries and is recommended to be enabled on all systems for correct update installation, Startup Disk control panel functioning, etc.
* **ReplaceTabWithSpace**: NO
   * Depending on the firmware, some system may need this to properly edit files in the UEFI shell when unable to handle Tabs. This swaps it for spaces instead-but majority can ignore it but do note that ConsoleControl set to True may be needed
* **SanitiseClearScreen**: NO
   * Fixes High resolutions displays that display OpenCore in 1024x768, recommened for user with 1080P+ displays
* **ClearScreenOnModeSwitch**: NO
   * Needed for when half of the previously drawn image remains, will force black screen before switching to TextMode. Do note that ConsoleControl set to True may be needed
* **UnblockFsConnect**: NO
   * Some firmware block partition handles by opening them in By Driver mode, which results in File System protocols being unable to install. Mainly relevant for HP systems when no drives are listed
